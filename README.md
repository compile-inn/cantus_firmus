# Cantus Firmus
This little program generates cantus firmus - fixed melodies used in counterpoint. This is a work in progess, so some stylistic rules are not in place yet. 

## To be added
- Cli (tone, mode and length selection)
- midi file creation

## Done
- Add get_note to translate readable note into midi note: C4 -> 60

## To be fixed
- Add support for flat alterations and scale: C4b
- fix the naming issue; C#5, A#5, G#5, D#5, C6, A#5, C6, C#6.
